# VOIDChain - A simple and high-performant distributed ledger technology platform

## Made For
* [Polytechnic of Leiria](https://www.ipleiria.pt/)
* [VOID Software](https://void.pt/)

## Description
Implementation of a Blockchain platform, VOIDChain, based on a popular Byzantine Fault-Tolerant state machine replication Java library, [BFT-SMaRt](https://bft-smart.github.io/library/).

## Objective
* Investigating distributed ledger technologies (DLT), crypto coins and consensus algorithm concepts and relate that knowledge with BFT-SMaRt.
* Development of actors to populate the network, such as nodes and lightweight clients.
* Development of a client wallet for storing asymmetric keys and transactions.
* Development of an API REST service for easier communication with external services.
* Development of an API REST service in conjunction with this application, which is available [here](https://github.com/pedrorpmoleiro/voidchain-api).
